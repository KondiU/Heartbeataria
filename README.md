# Heartbeataria

## **Heartbeataria** is a mod that aims to bring unique content from both old & new chinese Regional versions of Terraria back to global version of the game.

**This includes:**
- **Star Merchant** - a fan-favourite cut NPC from old chinese Terraria, re-imagined as completely new vendor
- Chinese-exclusive **Terraria x KFC** items
- **15 new vanity sets**
- **8 new pets**
- **5 new mounts**
- **8 new early-game weapons**
- **1 new accessory**
- **24 new paintings**
- **4 new furniture items**

This mod doesn't significantly affect the balance of vanilla game, so you can play it alongside other, larger content mods, such as [Thorium](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2909886416) or [Calamity](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2824688072) without any problems.

It is highly recommended to play this mod alongside [Consolaria](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2864843929), since both mods complement each other in aim to restore previously unaccessible features making the PC Terraria **the most complete experience ever!**

## Star Merchant
The **Star Merchant** is a unique NPC vendor who randomly visits the player's town for one day. Their inventory is randomized and different every visit, always selling:
- 1 melee weapon
- 1 disc weapon
- 2 pets
- 1 mount
- 3 furniture items
- Fusion Module
- 4 paintings 
- 1 to 2 vanity sets

They does not require their own house in order to spawn, and will instead spawn next to NPCs, including town pets, spending the day walking around them.

The Star Merchant has a 20% chance of spawning each day, appearing at a random time between 4:30 AM and 12:00 PM. The chances of them spawning are always the same regardless if the player is sleeping. They leave the same day at 6:00 PM, but can only do so once they are off-screen. They despawn if the world is vacated any time after they spawns.

## Mythical Vanity Sets 
**Mythical Vanity Sets** are new type of vanity sets inspired by implementation of **Horned God Set** from [Consolaria mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2864843929). Each of these four sets can be purchased from Travelling Merchant NPC at random times, after the player defeats a specific boss or event.
- **Mountain Guard Set**, available after defeating Eye of Cthulhu
- **Imperial Guard Set**, available after defeating Skeletron
- **Deep Cold Set**, available after defeating Ice Queen
