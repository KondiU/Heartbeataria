This mod doesn't significantly affect the balance of vanilla game, so you can play it alongside other, larger content mods, such as [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2909886416]Thorium[/url] or [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2824688072]Calamity[/url] without any problems.

It is highly recommended to play this mod alongside [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2864843929]Consolaria[/url], since both mods complement each other in aim to restore previously unaccessible features making the PC Terraria [b]the most complete experience ever![/b]
