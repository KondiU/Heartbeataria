Heartbeataria is a mod that aims to bring unique content from both old & new Chinese Regional versions of Terraria back to global version of the game.

This includes:
- Star Merchant - a fan-favourite cut NPC from old Chinese Terraria, re-imagined as completely new vendor
- Chinese-exclusive Terraria x KFC items
- 5 cut vanity sets from old Chinese Regional version of the game, re-imagined as completely new Mythical Vanity Sets
- 8 new pets
- 18 new vanity sets in total
- 5 new mounts
- 24 new paintings
- 4 new furniture items

This mod doesn't significantly affect the balance of vanilla game, so you can play it alongside other, larger content mods, such as Thorium or Calamity without any problems.

It is highly recommended to play this mod alongside Consolaria, since both mods complement each other in aim to restore previously unaccessible features making the PC Terraria the most complete experience ever!
